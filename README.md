# BR2R
Repo contains a BR2R algo implementation based on this [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/64dafb11e52edd3cd840bf24e56ddce6-Abstract.html).
The real world dataset is taken from (https://github.com/danielkorzekwa/atpworldtour-api) for tennis.
# Matrix completion
Matrix completion routine is implemented based on this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6751420).
The paper uses Unifying Nuclear Norm and Bilinear Factorization Approaches for Low-rank Matrix Decomposition
